				<h1>Usage</h1>
				<p class="subtitle">Last updated: 1 November 2024</p>
				<p>These guidelines goes into detail on what you may or may not do with my content, such as videos, audio, and images (including artwork). I made this on the off chance that someone would like to know my stance on a couple of things. This page will be updated whenever I see fit to include more details, so make sure to check back in the event that I do.</p>
				<p>You are fine to use any and all content I make, so long as usage falls under Fair Use laws and my set guidelines. That being said, I will not tolerate:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Usage in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)</li>
					<li>Minting on the blockchain as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and/or cryptocurrency</li>
					<li>Reuploading with no substantial modifications, ESPECIALLY for monetary gain</li>
					<li>Reactions that add little to nothing, and are without proper attribution/credit <b>and</b> a link to the original content</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Note that this also applies to content made by other people, and retroactively applies to all past works.</p>
				<p>If you do use my content, please make sure to credit me and link back. I'm very lenient on how this is done, but make sure that it is accessible and not easy to miss (as in, don't try to hide/obscure it).</p>
				<h2>Fanart</h2>
				<p>I am always accepting of fanart! If you have any to share, please do! However, do not make anything that can be reasonably considered harmful and offensive (including but not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, etc.). In short, have common sense.</p>
				<h3>NSFW</h3>
				<p>I am fine with NSFW art, but adhere to the above (that means no feral, incest, pedophilia, etc.), respect the respective character's sexuality, and always contact me if you're not sure of something. Do note that this differs between all of my characters, and that I will make it clear whether or not I am okay of NSFW being made for each one. If I haven't stated anything for a specific character, ask me to specify, and don't make NSFW of them until it is absolutely clear that doing so would be fine.</p>
				<p>Make sure that all NSFW is tagged appropriately to minimise the likelihood of minors stumbling upon it, whether that be putting it behind a filter or posting it under a private account. Also, do note that I may not want to see this out of the blue, so ask before showing me it!</p>
