				<h1>Usage</h1>
				<p class="subtitle">Last updated: 1 November 2024</p>
				<p>These guidelines goes into detail on what you may or may not do with my content, such as videos, audio, and images (including artwork). I made this on the off chance that someone would like to know my stance on a couple of things. This page will be updated whenever I see fit to include more details, so make sure to check back in the event that I do.</p>

					</ul>
				</div>
				<h2 id="general">General</h2>
				<p>You are fine to use any and all content I make, so long as usage falls under Fair Use laws and my set guidelines. That being said, I will not tolerate:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Usage in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)</li>
					<li>Minting on the blockchain as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and/or cryptocurrency</li>
					<li>Reuploading without any substantial modifications, especially for monetary gain
						<ul>
							<li>Includes reactions that add little to nothing, and are without proper attribution/credit <b>and</b> a link to the original content</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Note that this also applies to content made by other people, and retroactively applies to all past works.</p>
				<p>If you do use my content, please make sure to credit me and link back. I'm very lenient on how this is done, but make sure that it is accessible and not easy to miss (as in, don't try to hide/obscure it). This also applies to personal use of my artwork for profile pictures and/or banners.</p>
				<h2 id="characters">Characters</h2>
				<p>This section covers the guidelines set on interacting with my characters. Note that being inspired by my characters is allowed, but that the guidelines in terms of using my content applies here, and thus any major referencing and/or plagiarism is forbidden.</p>
				<h3>Fanart</h3>
				<p>I am always accepting of fanart! If you have any to share, please do! However, do not make anything that can be reasonably considered harmful and offensive (including but not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, etc.). In short, have common sense.</p>
				<h4>NSFW</h4>
				<p>I am fine with NSFW art, but adhere to the above (that means no feral, incest, pedophilia, etc.), respect the respective character's sexuality, and always contact me if you're not sure of something. Do note that this differs between all of my characters, and that I will make it clear whether or not I am okay of NSFW being made for each one. If I haven't stated anything for a specific character, ask me to specify, and don't make NSFW of them until it is absolutely clear that doing so would be fine.</p>
				<p>Make sure that all NSFW is tagged appropriately so that minors and people who wish not to see it don't stumble upon it, whether that be putting it behind a filter or posting it under a private account. Also, do note that I may not want to see this out of the blue, so ask before showing me it!</p>
				<h3>Kinning and Alters</h3>
				<p>Kinning is the act of relating to a character, or claiming you are them entirely. While I am more lenient with the former definition, the latter is a no-go.</p>
				<p>Alters, on the other hand, are unique identities within a dissociative identity disorder (DID) or other specified dissociative disorder (OSDD) system. If a new alter forms and happens to be of one of my characters, then I would be fine with this as this is a process that happens subconsciously, and therefore unavoidable. Keep in mind not to associate them with me in any canonical way, though.</p>
				<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>No GenAI and NFTs, no reuploading w/o notable changes/commentary (in reactions) and credit, especially w/ monetization</li>
					<li>Always credit me and link back, but don't hide/obscure it, make it notably visible</li>
					<li>No major referencing/plagiarism of my characters</li>
					<li>Fanart is appreciated, no offensive content</li>
					<li>Be respectful when it comes to NSFW, respect guidelines set for each character
						<ul>
							<li>Appropriately tag NSFW to prevent minors and averse people from finding it</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Kinning is allowed, so long as you don't claim you <i>are</i> them
						<ul>
							<li>The latter does not apply to alters, but direct association with me is discouraged</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
