				<h1>Usage Guidelines</h1>
				<p class="subtitle">Last updated: 11 March 2025</p>
				<p>These guidelines goes into detail on what you may or may not do with all content I make, such as videos, audio, and images, including but not limited to artwork, voice acting, and gameplay footage. These guidelines were put in place on the off chance that someone would like to know my stance on a couple of things, and will be updated whenever I see fit to include more details, so please check back every now and then.</p>
				<p>If you would like a shortened version of the guidelines, please refer to the "TL;DR" section located at the bottom of the page. You can also go to it by clicking on the corresponding link in the list of contents directly below this paragraph.</p>
				<div id="contents">
					<p>Jump to...</p>
					<ul class="link-list">
						<li><a href="#general">General</a></li><li><a href="#characters">Characters</a></li><li><a href="#tldr">TL;DR</a></li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<h2 id="general">General</h2>
				<p>You are fine to use any and all content I make, so long as usage falls under Fair Use laws and my set guidelines. That being said, I will not tolerate:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Usage in and for generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)</li>
					<li>Minting on the blockchain as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and/or cryptocurrency</li>
					<li>Reuploading without any substantial modifications, especially for monetary gain
						<ul>
							<li>Includes reactions that add little to nothing, and are without proper attribution/credit <b>and</b> a link to the original content</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>These set guidelines apply retroactively to all past works.</p>
				<p>If you do use my content, please make sure to credit me and link back. I'm very lenient on how this is done, but make sure that it is accessible and not easy to miss (as in, don't try to hide/obscure it). This also applies to personal use of my artwork for profile pictures and/or banners.</p>
				<h2 id="characters">Characters</h2>
				<p>This section covers the guidelines set on interacting with my characters. Note that being inspired by my characters is allowed, but that the guidelines in terms of using my content applies here, and thus any major referencing and/or plagiarism is forbidden.</p>
				<h3>Fanart</h3>
				<p>I am always accepting of fanart! If you have any to share, please do! However, do not make anything that can be reasonably considered harmful and offensive (including but not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, etc.). In short, have common sense.</p>
				<h4>NSFW</h4>
				<p>Conditional based on the character in question. Please refer to - and respect - the listed guidelines on the respective Toyhouse pages. NSFW is a <b>strict, automatic no</b> when it comes to underaged and feral characters. Depictions of fetishism is also strictly prohibited.</p>
				<p>All NSFW is to be tagged appropriately to prevent minors and averse people from seeing it out of the blue. This can be done through the usage of tags/words that people can mute, and/or putting it behind a filter and/or locked account. Keep in mind that I willingly do not want to see art of this kind out of the blue, ask me beforehand.</p>
				<h3>Fictives</h3>
				<p>Kinning and the formation of alters (unique identities within a dissociative identity disorder (DID) or other specified dissociative disorder (OSDD) system) are two completely different topics that shall be treated differently when it comes to claiming to be one of my characters. Keep in mind that I am more lenient with alters, not as much with kins. Kinning when it comes to relating with a character is completely fine, however.</p>
				<p>Direct, canonical assocation of alters with me is discouraged, and keep in mind to credit me for all personal usage of my material as is stated under the "General" section.</p>
				<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>No GenAI and NFTs, no reuploading w/o notable changes/commentary (especially in reactions) and credit, strictly no monetization of such either</li>
					<li>Always credit me and link back. Don't hide/obscure it, make it notably visible</li>
					<li>No major referencing/plagiarism of my characters</li>
					<li>Fanart is appreciated, no offensive content</li>
					<li>Be respectful when it comes to NSFW, respect guidelines set for each character, ask before showing me art of the kind
						<ul>
							<li>Appropriately tag NSFW to prevent minors and averse people from finding it</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Kinning is allowed, so long as you don't claim you <i>are</i> them
						<ul>
							<li>The latter does not apply to alters, but direct association with me is discouraged</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
